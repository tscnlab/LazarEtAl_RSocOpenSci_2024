In the first section <span style="color: blue;">*[1] Loading subdatasets*</span> we load the `conf_subdata.rda` file, which includes an image of the environment with all subdatasets generated from the `50_subdatasets.R` code.

In section <span style="color: blue;">*[2] Testing log-transformation*</span> we run additional analyses regarding the log-10 transformation of the light data. After realizing that the linear light data violate the assumptions of linear regression models, we generated log10-transformed light variables with which the requirements were approximately met. Here, we additionally tested whether the transformation improved the fit in the LMM, comparing the model with log10 transformation against a null model with linear light data in the same procedure as our hypothesis tests specified in the pre-registered analysis. The BF10 clearly shows evidence in favour of log10-transformation.

In code section <span style="color: blue;">*[3] Positive control tests*</span> we test our confirmatory hypotheses in the controlled laboratory conditions as positive control tests. 

First, we tested hypothesis CH1 with the linear models specified in stage 1 of our report with data from our laboratory conditions (subdataset "Labdata"). The models are tested with log10-transformed and linear (non-transformed) mEDI as a predictor.

Secondly, we tested hypothesis CH2 with the linear models specified in stage 1 of our report with data from our laboratory conditions (subdataset "Labdata"). Note that under these conditions, the light units mEDI and photopic lux are somewhat dissociated. Again, the test is once run for a model including the log10-transformed light data (mEDI and photopic illuminance) and once with non-transformed light data.

Lastly, we test our age hypothesis CH3 in the data from the 10-minute dark adaptation (subdataset "Darkdata") as a positive control, where we expected the age effect to be most pronounced. In the tested models, no light variables are used as a predictor because these samples were taken in darkness, where the light measurements are not valid.

To double check that our tests conducted with the "BayesFactors" package were valid, we additionally ran a test comparing the two models defined with a function from the *lme4* & *lmerTest* packages ("lmer") and compared the two models from CH2 regarding their Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The resulting BIC value for the full model is lower for the full model than with the null model, confirming the results from the BayesFactor analysis.

We then approximated the the Bayes factors from BICs computed in the *lme4* package using the  equation by [Wagenmakers (2007)](https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03194105), retrieved from [Stevens (2019)](https://osf.io/eszbd), resulting in very similar Bayes Factor magnitudes.

In the code given in <span style="color: blue;">*[6] Hypothesis testing - CH3*</span> , we test our confirmatory hypothesis CH3 in the data from the field condition (subdataset "Fielddata"). First, we conduct the test  with models including the log10-transformed mEDI  predictor and then secondly with the linear mEDI predictor.

In the code section <span style="color: blue;">*[7] Exploratory analyses - EH*</span> we analyse our exploratory analyses specified in the Stage 2 RR manuscript. The analysis procedure corresponds to the confirmatory hypotheses. However, we only include log10-transformed mEDI as a predictor in these cases.

- *EH1: Sex differences in light-adapted pupil size are present under real-world conditions.*
- *EH2: Light-adapted pupil size varies as a function of iris colour under real-world conditions.*
- *EH3: Light-adapted pupil size varies as a function of habitual caffeine consumption (relative to body weight) under real-world conditions.*
- *EH4: Light-adapted pupil size varies as a function of the acute caffeine consumption (relative to body weight) under real-world conditions.*
